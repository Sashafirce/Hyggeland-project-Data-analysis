•	Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?
**The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations**
•	List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations 
**Analysis techniques used**
•	List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.

**Ethical considerations**
•	Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
•	How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

**Unfixed Bugs**
•	Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
•	Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
•	If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.
**Development Roadmap**
•	What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
•	What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience?

**Main Data Analysis Libraries**
•	Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.
Credits
•	In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.
•	You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

**Media**
